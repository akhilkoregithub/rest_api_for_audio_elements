The AudioElement model in the provided models.py file represents an audio element with various fields and functionality. 
The AudioElement model inherits from Django's models.Model class, which provides the necessary functionality for creating and managing database models.

The AudioElement model has following below fields:
id, url, type (audio_type), high_volune and low_volune, start_time and end_time.
The save method is overridden to include additional functionality when saving an AudioElement. If the audio element is not of type 'video_music', it checks for any existing elements of the same type with overlapping time ranges. If overlaps are found, it adjusts the start time and end time accordingly to ensure they do not overlap. If the audio element is of type 'video_music', the start and end times.
Save method avoids overlapping audio elements: By adjusting the start and end times of the audio elements, the save method ensures that elements of the same type do not overlap. This can be useful in scenarios where overlapping elements could cause conflicts or undesirable behavior.
